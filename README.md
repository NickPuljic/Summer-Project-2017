# nuenen

This is the project I worked on this past summer. I wrote the back-end/front-end in clojure/clojurescript. It has been modified to not require a database, but one could be easily hooked up.


## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed. You will also need sassc. The easiest way to install it is "brew install sassc".

## Running

    lein run
    lein figwheel

Connect to localhost:3000. The email and password I have manually included are:
